Hi,

About the MVC framework which I didn't use in this project, 
In most projects I did in previous works, I just developed it from scratch with the team.
So even though I know the concept of the MVC framework, I'm not familiar with specific ones like Zend, Laravel.
That's the reason that I didn't use it. But I did this project with php5 oop programming.

About the frontend framework, I just displayed the result of the project by using the Bootstrap.

What I did contains 4 files that are 'db_table_create.php', 'database.php', 'index.php', 'purchase_import.php'
I used the file (data.cvs) which you provided me with. I tested it in my local environment with success.

About the file called 'db_table_create.php', I created it just for my test environment with server(localhost), db name(nrigroup),
db user(root), db password(rootadmin). If you review and test it in your environment which might be different with mine, 
just ignore this file or modify it according to yours.

Thanks..
