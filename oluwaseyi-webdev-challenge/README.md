# Oluwaseyi Olarotimi's completion of the NRE Webdev-Challenge

Completing this project was a very amazing journey for me as I had little knowledge of Laravel before this project. I had one week to study Laravel and complete this challenge and I am very glad I was able to complete this project on time. I hope I meet your expectations of clean and professional programming style. Enjoy!
