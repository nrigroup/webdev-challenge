Step1: execute "DATABASE.sql" in your mysql manager to create database and related table.

Step2: How to execute project:
http://localhost/laravel_csv/public/csv/upload
(where laravel_csv is the project directory name)

I could have optimized database by introducing category master and address master table which is not a big deal. But this is just the basic work to demonstrate my basic skills.

Thank you.
