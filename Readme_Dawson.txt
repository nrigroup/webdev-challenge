What I am most proud of about my submission is the inclusion of Homestead within the distribution. It is an incredibly important asset to a development team to work within the same environment, and that is what Homestead delivers. I also was able to include the upload code for a file in Laravel. I was unable to complete the project, however, Laravel is a new framework to me, and I was not yet up to task to handle the backend component of the project, though I did begin to learn, and find this framework very interesting. In regards to the SSH keys, I have included them in the home directory though I do not have that drive set in the homestead.yaml file, so please be aware of this if if attempting to launch. Also you may be reqiured to add a site association (192.168.10.10  homestead.app) in your host directory to launch locally, and virtual box may need to be installed. I have not played around with distributing on another computer yet.
