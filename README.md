I have not been able to implement the functionalities of uploading the CSV file into the database due debugging issues. I gave it my best shot. Despite spending two hours on it, I was not able to progress past the issue. Instead, I decided to showcase my ability to create a clean  front-end, and an easy-to-use UI.

I really wish I had more time to find a solution to the issue I was facing. Unfortunately I could not spend more than the time I did because of school work. I think there was a lot that I could learn from this challenge, especially because it was the first time I had to upload a csv file into a database.

Thank you for the opportunity.
P.S. This was the issue I came across;
	Error: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'pre_tax_amount' in 'field list'
