# NRI Web Development Challenge
I didn't use any PHP framework as it only required few lines of code to accomplish the task and using a framework for it could make it heavier on server resources.
I just used bootstrap for the frontend to make it responsive and look better.

## Installation Instructions
1. Upload the entire package to your server.
2. Specify database credentials in site.inc.php
3. Browse to the 'install' folder. For ex: http://www.YourWebsite.com/install/
4. Simply, browse to the uploaded folder. For ex, if the files were uploaded to the root of your website then: http://www.YourWebsite.com and upload the CSV file.
