# NRI Web Development Challenge

##Project

This a Development Challenge for NRI, I like the fact that there are two tables indicating the different groupings and they are aligned.

##Instructions
1. Make sure you have [laravel](https://laravel.com/) installed.
2. Copy the NRI folder.
3. Run `php artisan serve` in the NRI folder

##Note
The files are not saved in the RDB and just placed in a temp folder.
